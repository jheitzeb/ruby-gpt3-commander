An artificially intelligent browser extension helps people surf the web.
It works by taking a simple command and expanding it into actions that are performed by the web browser.
The AI attempts to behave like a human would when using the web to research topics, by asking good questions.

Original command: 
{{human_entries}}

Expanded commands and results:
{{history}}

State the result that the AI found, and explain in detail why the result is valid (or not) and explain in English how it arrived at this result.
